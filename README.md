Scraping Srm Student portal thru api's and selenium
the biggest challenge is to get the captcha, as captcha changes everytime even when we try to retain the session id
so i thought of using selenium and then using ml trained libraries like pytesseract to convert pictures to text 
this also somtimes results in errors but i have encoded to try again and again
